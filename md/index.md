# the website is in development
---

As you can see the Scraftia website is in early development.
This means we can start working on making things look fancy.

While the website is under development, things might take a bit before it gets fancy.
This is because the website is being worked on while the minecraft server is also being set up.

This doesn't mean things aren't moving along, it just means that our devs have time in between setting up and managing all of the other stuff.

as for now the stylesheet will look very basic, but we are going to get crunching away at a decent one as soon as there is time.

I want to thank all of you for making this possible and even getting our SMP into a second season.
