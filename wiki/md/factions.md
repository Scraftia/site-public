Factions are a group of players and clans that choose to unite under a common banner.

## Short version

Factions are the most powerful type of faction in Scraftia even able to force reevaluation of decisions made by the Scraftia global court.
They are also able to force restrictions on member clans.

The main role of a faction is to take part in regulating members and clans alongside the Scraftia global court and other systems set in place (basically, they're the anti-nuking board)
As a secondary role they are also able to provide benefits to it's member clans that would otherwise impossible to gain.

## Creating a faction

### Prerequisites
In order to create a faction a few prerequisite conditions must be met.

1. Any new faction must have at least 5 member clans
2. Any new faction must have an independent faction master
3. Any new faction must have the required infrastructure for operation:
	- A master faction hall.
	- A master court
	- Housing for it's workers.
	- Accessible connection to it's member clans

Registering your faction can only happen through the Scraftia global court.
Doing this can be done by submitting a formal registration request, once this has been done you will be contacted by the Scraftia global court.

**!IMPORTANT**
Only the appointed future factionleader is allowed to submit this request, if another factionleader is desired after submitting this request the currently appointed factionleader has to wait and appoint a new factionleader once he is in office.
Alternatively, if the factionleader is unable to perform his duty; the member clans can decide to veto the submission by majority vote.

### Faction registration
Once a request has been filed and you have been contacted by the Scraftia global court, you are now to follow their orders.
They will look over your registration request and process it accordingly.
