#### 3.1 Groups

The majority of the rules mirror the rules of section 2, but a few additional ones apply.

Groups cannot:
1. be part of a faction or clan (even though it's members can)
2. own land or property (even though individual members can)

Factions can:

2. Employ players and clans as members.
