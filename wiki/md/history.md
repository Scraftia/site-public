# History

Scraftia is a group with a rich history, because of this we decided to make a wiki page outlining all of the important parts

## Introduction

We will be going over the entire history in chronological order.  
in order to aid you we have split the document into several parts so you can catch up on the parts that you need without having to read through the entire thing.

the parts are:

- [The pre-Scraftia era](#the-pre-scraftia-era)

- Season 1

- Season 2

- Season 3

- Season 4

## The pre-Scraftia era

Before Scraftia existed there were 2 discord groups with a minecraft server each, these servers were very small SMPs with a small group dedicated to working together (yes, Scraftia members used to be able to get along)

### The no sleep before 10 AM squad

too sleepy to document

### Sleepless Faggots

*snores*

## Season 1

some shit happened, we don't know what exactly.

## Season 2

other shit happened, but with claims this time

## Season 3

contrary to what people might tell you, season 3 is not a thing, it does not exist

## Season 4

Nothing to note as of yet.
